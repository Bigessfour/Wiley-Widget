      usage_instructions: |
        To use this config:
        1. Ensure API key is set in environment.
        2. Enable agentic mode in continue.json.
        3. Use tools for file operations and code evaluation.
        4. Stream responses for real-time observability.
        5. Monitor reasoning tokens and tool calls in Output.

- name: Open Source Grok Config
  version: 1.0.0
  schema: v1
  models:
    - name: Grok-1
      provider: xAI (Open Source)
      model: grok-1
      description: Open-sourced by xAI under Apache 2.0 license. This is the base 314B parameter Mixture-of-Experts model. Not fine-tuned for dialogue like the hosted Grok versions.
      setup_instructions: |
        To use this open-source model:
        1. Download the model weights from the xAI GitHub repository or Hugging Face (search for xai-org/grok-1).
        2. Install dependencies: pip install torch transformers
        3. Load in Python:
           from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
           model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("path/to/grok-1")
           tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("path/to/grok-1")
        4. For inference, you'll need significant GPU resources (e.g., multiple A100 GPUs).
        Note: This is not 'Grok-4' as no such version is publicly available or open-sourced. If you meant a different model, clarify.
