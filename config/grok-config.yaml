      description: Configuration for accessing the Grok-4 model via xAI's paid API. Ensure you have a valid subscription and comply with xAI's terms of service.
      usage_instructions: |
        To use this config:
        1. Integrate with an API client that supports xAI's endpoint (e.g., similar to OpenAI's API structure).
        2. Example Python usage:
           import requests
           url = "https://api.x.ai/v1/chat/completions"  # Replace with actual xAI API endpoint
           headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {apiKey}"}
           payload = {"model": "grok-4", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}]}
           response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
        3. Note: API endpoints and availability may vary; check xAI documentation for the latest details. Grok-4 may not be publicly available yet—verify with xAI.

- name: Open Source Grok Config
  version: 1.0.0
  schema: v1
  models:
    - name: Grok-1
      provider: xAI (Open Source)
      model: grok-1
      description: Open-sourced by xAI under Apache 2.0 license. This is the base 314B parameter Mixture-of-Experts model. Not fine-tuned for dialogue like the hosted Grok versions.
      setup_instructions: |
        To use this open-source model:
        1. Download the model weights from the xAI GitHub repository or Hugging Face (search for xai-org/grok-1).
        2. Install dependencies: pip install torch transformers
        3. Load in Python:
           from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
           model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("path/to/grok-1")
           tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("path/to/grok-1")
        4. For inference, you'll need significant GPU resources (e.g., multiple A100 GPUs).
        Note: This is not 'Grok-4' as no such version is publicly available or open-sourced. If you meant a different model, clarify.
