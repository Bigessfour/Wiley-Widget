# Reports Templates

Drop FastReport `.frx` templates into this directory so the Reports view can load them at runtime.

This placeholder file ensures the `Reports` folder is tracked in Git and copied to the build output. Add one file per report type (matching the friendly names listed in `ReportsViewModel.AvailableReportTypes`) and the application will automatically discover them.
