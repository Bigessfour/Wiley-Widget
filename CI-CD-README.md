# Wiley Widget - CI/CD Pipeline (90% Success Rate Initiative)

## üöÄ Overview

This repository implements an enterprise-grade CI/CD pipeline designed to achieve and maintain a **90% success rate** through advanced reliability features, parallel execution, and comprehensive monitoring.

## üìä Pipeline Features

### Core Reliability Features

  - Environment-specific configurations

#### 4. `maintenance.yml` (Scheduled)
- **Purpose**: Automated pipeline maintenance
- **Triggers**: Daily at 2 AM UTC + Manual
- **Features**:
  - Health checks and cleanup
  - Dependency optimization
  - Success rate analysis
  - Maintenance reporting

#### 5. `ci.yml` (Legacy - Deprecated)
- **Status**: Deprecated - Use `ci-optimized.yml`
- **Purpose**: Basic CI pipeline (kept for reference)

## üõ†Ô∏è Scripts

```

## üìà Achieving 90% Success Rate

### Key Strategies

1. **Health Validation**
   - Pre-build environment checks
   - Dependency validation
   - Network connectivity tests

2. **Retry Mechanisms**
   - Exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s)
   - Maximum retry limits (3-5 attempts)
   - Circuit breaker for persistent failures

3. **Parallel Execution**
   - Matrix-based test execution
   - Concurrent job processing
   - Resource optimization

4. **Monitoring & Alerting**
   - Real-time success rate tracking
   - Failure pattern analysis
   - Automated alerts for issues

5. **Emergency Mode**
   - Graceful degradation
   - Reduced test suites during issues
   - Priority-based execution

### Success Metrics

- **Target**: 90%+ pipeline success rate
- **Monitoring**: Daily success rate reports
- **Alerting**: Notifications for <85% success rates
- **Recovery**: Automated retry and circuit breaker reset

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
```yaml
DOTNET_VERSION: '9.0.x'
CI: true
GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### Required Secrets
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: For GitHub API access
- `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`: For Azure deployments (if applicable)

## üìã Maintenance

### Daily Tasks (Automated)
- Health validation
- Build artifact cleanup
- Dependency updates check
- Success rate analysis

### Weekly Tasks
- Review success rate reports
- Update dependencies
- Security vulnerability scans

### Monthly Tasks
- Full pipeline audit
- Performance optimization
- Documentation updates

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Pipeline Failures
1. Check health validation logs
2. Review retry attempt details
3. Verify circuit breaker status
4. Analyze failure patterns

#### Low Success Rates
1. Run `monitor-cicd.ps1` for analysis
2. Check for environmental issues
3. Review recent changes
4. Consider emergency mode

#### Build Issues
1. Verify .NET version consistency
2. Check dependency conflicts
3. Review build logs for errors
4. Use health check script

### Emergency Procedures

1. **Enable Emergency Mode**
   ```yaml
   emergency_mode: true
   reduced_test_suite: true
   ```

2. **Manual Health Check**
   ```powershell
   .\scripts\health-check.ps1 -Verbose
   ```

3. **Force Pipeline Reset**
   - Clear build cache
   - Reset circuit breaker
   - Restart with minimal configuration
