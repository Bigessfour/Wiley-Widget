# Reference Library

This folder contains the full set of detailed documentation that previously lived in the root of `docs/`. Files are organized alphabetically; use search or the table below to locate a topic quickly.

| Category                | Location                                      | Description                                                  |

| Architecture Deep Dives | `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `architecture/`            | Full-length architecture documentation                       |
| Checklists & Guides     | `checklists/`, `guides/`                      | Task-specific procedures and checklists                      |
| Integrations            | `integrations/`, `MCP_*`, `SYNCFUSION_*` docs | External system notes and integration guides                 |
| Theming & UI            | `FLUENTDARK_*.md`, `THEME_*.md`, `UI_*` docs  | Visual theming and UI polish                                 |

All files were preserved during the cleanup so that no historical knowledge was lost. When creating new long-form documentation, prefer placing it in this folder unless it is required reading for every contributor (in which case update the appropriate guide under `docs/core/`).
