# .NET Process Management - Professional Development Practices

## Overview
Orphaned .NET processes during development are a common issue. This document outlines professional approaches to manage them effectively.

## üõ†Ô∏è Available Tools

### 1. VS Code Tasks
- **`kill-dotnet`**: Intelligent process cleanup with parent process detection
- **`build-clean`**: Combined cleanup + build (used automatically in debug launches)
- **`cleanup-dotnet`**: Full cleanup including build artifacts

### 2. PowerShell Scripts
- **`scripts/kill-dotnet.ps1`**: Advanced process management script
  - Orphaned process detection using Windows API
  - Parent process analysis
  - Intelligent cleanup with confirmation
  - Monitoring mode for development

### 3. PowerShell Profile Integration
- **`scripts/PowerShell-Profile.ps1`**: Add to `$PROFILE` for convenience functions
  - `cleanup` / `Invoke-DotNetCleanup`: Quick cleanup
  - `dotnet-watch` / `Start-DotNetWatch`: Watch mode with auto-cleanup
  - `psdotnet` / `Get-DotNetProcesses`: List .NET processes

## üöÄ Usage Patterns

### Development Workflow
```powershell
# Quick cleanup
cleanup -Force

# Clean build with process cleanup
# (Automatic in VS Code debug launches)

# Monitor processes during development
.\scripts\kill-dotnet.ps1 -Monitor

# Full cleanup including artifacts
cleanup -Force -Clean
```

### VS Code Integration
- **F5 Debug**: Automatically runs `build-clean` (cleanup + build)
- **Ctrl+Shift+P ‚Üí "Tasks: Run Task" ‚Üí "kill-dotnet"**: Manual cleanup
- **Pre-build**: Cleanup runs before every debug session

### CI/CD Integration
```yaml
# Add to GitHub Actions or other CI
- name: Cleanup .NET processes
  run: .\scripts\kill-dotnet.ps1 -Force -Clean
  shell: pwsh
```

## üîß Advanced Features

### Intelligent Orphan Detection
The script distinguishes between:
- **Truly orphaned**: No parent process or parent exited
- **Development processes**: Children of VS Code, Visual Studio, etc.
- **System processes**: Services and background tasks

### Process Analysis
```powershell
# See detailed process information
psdotnet

# Monitor for new orphans
.\scripts\kill-dotnet.ps1 -Monitor
```

### Build Artifact Cleanup
```powershell
# Remove build artifacts that can cause issues
cleanup -Clean
# Cleans: bin/, obj/, .vs/, TestResults/, *.log, *.tmp
```

## üèÜ Professional Best Practices

### 1. **Pre-Debug Cleanup**
- VS Code automatically cleans before debugging
- Prevents port conflicts and resource issues

### 2. **Session Management**
```powershell
# Add to PowerShell profile for auto-cleanup
. .\scripts\PowerShell-Profile.ps1
```

### 3. **Team Consistency**
- All team members use the same cleanup scripts
- Consistent development environment

### 4. **CI/CD Hygiene**
- Clean processes before builds
- Prevent resource exhaustion on build agents

### 5. **Monitoring & Alerting**
- Use monitoring mode during active development
- Catch issues early

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Processes won't die**: Use `-Force` flag
- **False positives**: Script analyzes parent processes intelligently
- **Performance impact**: Cleanup is fast (< 2 seconds typically)

### Debug Mode
```powershell
# Enable detailed logging
$DebugPreference = "Continue"
cleanup -Force
```

### Manual Override
```powershell
# Kill all dotnet processes (brute force)
Get-Process dotnet -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Stop-Process -Force
```

## üìä Performance Impact

- **Cleanup time**: < 2 seconds
- **Memory usage**: Minimal (~5MB)
- **System impact**: None during monitoring
- **Build time**: No impact (cleanup is separate)

## üîí Safety Features

- **Confirmation prompts**: Unless `-Force` is used
- **Parent process validation**: Prevents killing legitimate processes
- **Error handling**: Continues on individual process failures
- **Logging**: All actions are logged for audit

## üéØ Integration Points

### With Existing Tools
- **Trunk CI**: Add cleanup to pre-commit hooks
- **GitHub Actions**: Use in workflow steps
- **Azure DevOps**: Pipeline task integration

### IDE Extensions
- **VS Code**: Tasks and launch configuration
- **Visual Studio**: External tool integration
- **Rider**: Run configurations

This approach eliminates orphaned process issues while maintaining development productivity and system stability.
