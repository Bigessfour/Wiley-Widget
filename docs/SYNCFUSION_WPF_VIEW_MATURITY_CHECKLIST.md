# Syncfusion WPF View Maturity Checklist

## Overview
This checklist captures the maturity criteria required for Wiley Widget Syncfusion WPF views that participate in the Prism MVVM composition. It consolidates guidance from Syncfusion documentation, Microsoft MVVM resources, and previously validated community references. Use it to audit any XAML view (for example `SettingsView.xaml`, `MainWindow.xaml`, or module dashboards) before shipping a feature-complete experience.

## 1. XAML File Checklist (Structure, Bindings, Syncfusion Controls)
A production-ready view is purely declarative, relies on Prism auto-wiring, and applies Syncfusion-specific configuration to deliver consistent theming, binding, and performance.

| Element | Description and Requirement | Validation Check | Wiley Widget Tie-In |
|---------|-----------------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| Namespaces | Declare Syncfusion (`xmlns:syncfusion="http://schemas.syncfusion.com/wpf"`), Prism (`xmlns:prism="http://prismlibrary.com"`), and local namespaces (for example `xmlns:viewModels="clr-namespace:WileyWidget.ViewModels"`). Add theme namespaces when needed, such as `xmlns:sfskin="clr-namespace:Syncfusion.SfSkinManager;assembly=Syncfusion.SfSkinManager.WPF"`. | Root element resolves all required namespaces without build warnings. | Ensures controls such as `SfDataGrid`, `SfTabControlExt`, and Prism view wiring function as expected. |
| DataContext & MVVM Binding | Set `prism:ViewModelLocator.AutoWireViewModel="True"` and avoid manually assigning DataContext in code-behind. | ViewModel resolves through Prism container; no manual wiring or static DataContext assignments. | Keeps module registration lightweight and consistent with Prism region configuration. |
| Syncfusion Controls | Prefer Syncfusion controls (for example `SfDataGrid`, `SfComboBox`, `SfButton`). Configure grids with `AutoGenerateColumns="False"`, explicit column definitions, and features like filtering or editing where appropriate. | Controls expose their full capability without relying on default WPF equivalents. | Supports enterprise-grade grids and dashboards planned for Wiley Widget. |
| Bindings | Bind every visual element to ViewModel properties or commands with accurate modes and update triggers. Avoid literal values unless constant. | Bindings update as state changes; no binding errors in output window. | Enables live enterprise, budget, and analytics data updates. |
| Commands | Wire Syncfusion behaviors or button actions to DelegateCommands (for example, command bindings in templates). | Zero event handlers in XAML; all user actions dispatch to ViewModel commands. | Integrates with existing command surfaces in `MainViewModel`. |
| Themes & Styling | Apply `SfSkinManager` themes (`sfskin:SfSkinManager.Theme="{sfskin:SyncfusionTheme ThemeName=FluentDark}"`) at the root, reuse shared resource dictionaries, and avoid inline styling. | Theme rendering consistent across Shell, dashboards, and dialogs. | Matches Syncfusion license configuration and theming strategy in startup sequence. |
| Templates & Resources | Use `DataTemplate` or `ItemTemplate` for complex cells, provide `EditTemplate` where editing occurs, and centralize reusable resources. | Templates resolve without runtime exceptions; resource keys unique. | Supports tailored dashboards (for example AI assist panels, analytics cards). |
| Performance Optimizations | Enable virtualization (`VirtualizingStackPanel.IsVirtualizing="True"`, `EnableDataVirtualization="True"` where supported), tune column sizing (for example `ColumnSizer="Star"`), and defer heavy content. | UI handles large data sets without UI thread stalls. | Essential for financial data grids and analytics views. |
| Accessibility & Localization | Specify `AutomationProperties.Name` and `AutomationProperties.HelpText`, and source user-facing strings from resources. Provide keyboard navigation cues. | Screen reader friendly, ready for localization. | Aligns with municipal compliance requirements. |
| Validation & Error Handling | Bind with validation support (`ValidatesOnNotifyDataErrors`, `ValidationRules`). Display errors via styles or default WPF validation visuals. | Users see actionable validation feedback; no silent failures. | Complements IDataErrorInfo implementations in domain models. |

## 2. Code-Behind Checklist (Maintain MVVM Discipline)
Code-behind should be minimal and UI-specific only.

| Element | Description and Requirement | Validation Check | Wiley Widget Tie-In |
|---------|-----------------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| Constructor | Call `InitializeComponent()` and perform only UI setup that cannot be expressed in XAML. | Constructor shorter than ten lines; no service calls. | Avoids conflicts with Prism container resolution. |
| Event Handling | Do not handle events directly; forward unavoidable events to the ViewModel via commands or behaviors. | Zero event handlers or only pass-through logic calling `ViewModel` members. | Maintains testability and region friendliness. |
| Dependency Properties | Declare dependency properties only when exposing UI-specific features to XAML consumers. | Dependency properties registered with metadata and change callbacks call into ViewModel if needed. | Supports custom Syncfusion user controls if introduced. |
| Overrides & Methods | override WPF lifecycle methods only for presentation adjustments (for example template hooks). Use try/catch solely for logging UI exceptions. | No business logic; logging uses existing Serilog pipeline. | Keeps logging consistent with `App.xaml.cs` bootstrap process. |
| Resource Cleanup | Manage disposable UI resources in `Loaded`/`Unloaded` while unsubscribing events to avoid leaks. | Memory profile stays clean during navigation stress tests. | Critical for data-heavy dashboards with docking layouts. |

## 3. ViewModel Checklist (Logic, Commands, Validation)
ViewModels orchestrate data access, commands, validation, and state.

| Element | Description and Requirement | Validation Check | Wiley Widget Tie-In |
|---------|-----------------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| Base Class & Interfaces | Derive from Prism `BindableBase`/`AsyncViewModelBase` and implement `INotifyPropertyChanged`. Implement `INotifyDataErrorInfo` or `IDataErrorInfo` where validation is required. | Property change notifications fire reliably; validation surfaces in bindings. | Matches `MainViewModel` design pattern. |
| Properties | Use `ObservableCollection<T>` for lists and `SetProperty` in setters. Raise property-changed for dependent properties. | UI reacts instantly to data changes. | Supports responsive budget and enterprise views. |
| Commands | Implement `DelegateCommand`/`DelegateCommand<T>` with `CanExecute` logic. Async commands should capture exceptions. | Commands enable/disable appropriately and bubble errors correctly. | Aligns with existing refresh, import, and navigation command surfaces. |
| Data Loading | Inject repositories/services via constructor. Load data asynchronously with proper cancellation/Busy indicators. | ViewModel resilient to slow IO and reports progress to UI. | Integrates with EF Core repositories and QuickBooks services. |
| Validation | Aggregate validation errors and expose them to the UI. Use domain validation attributes where practical. | Invalid input flagged before persistence; errors displayed. | Protects financial data accuracy and compliance. |
| State Management | Expose state flags such as `IsBusy`, `BusyMessage`, and derived metrics. Reset state on navigation. | Busy indicators map correctly to UI (for example `SfBusyIndicator`). | Already leveraged in `MainViewModel`; keep consistent. |
| Performance | Defer expensive operations, avoid blocking UI thread, and profile high-impact commands. | Long-running operations offload to background tasks while updating progress. | Important for QuickBooks sync, large exports, and analytics modules. |
| Testability | Keep public methods unit-test friendly. Hide UI-specific logic behind interfaces so mocks can simulate data. | Commands and loaders validated in unit tests. | Supports existing xUnit and pytest coverage goals. |
| Localization & Accessibility | Centralize display strings, expose accessible names, and consider locale-specific formats. | View output adapts to culture settings in tests. | Prepares dashboards for multi-tenant deployments. |

## Scoring Guide
- **Mature**: 90% or more checklist items satisfied. Ready for production and UI showcases.
- **Stable**: 70% to 89% satisfied. Solid for internal previews; plan refinements before final release.
- **Needs Attention**: Less than 70% satisfied. Schedule refactorings to avoid technical debt.

Always complete a build (`dotnet build WileyWidget.csproj`), run automated UI scans (`python tools/xaml_sleuth.py`), and execute relevant unit/integration tests after view changes.
