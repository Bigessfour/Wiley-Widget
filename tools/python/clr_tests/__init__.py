"""Package initializer for Python CLR integration tests.

This module runs early when pytest imports test modules as the `tests` package.
We use it to import pythonnet (clr) early and to ensure the native .NET
probes (WPF bin folder) are on PATH so subsequent `from System import ...`
imports succeed during test collection.
