Alright, Mayor, buckle up— we're about to turn your Wiley Widget into a QuickBooks whisperer without it turning into one of those "integration nightmares" that make accountants weep. Think of this as matchmaking: Wiley's small-town charm meets QBO's corporate efficiency, but with enough sarcasm to keep it from getting too lovey-dovey. We'll map your enterprises (Water, Sewer, Trash, Apartments) to QBO's world using classes for fund segregation—because nothing says "muni accounting" like pretending QBO is built for governments. It's not perfect (QBO's more non-profit/small-biz than full GASB fund accounting), but with classes mimicking funds, sub-accounts for banks, and API hooks, it'll handle self-sustaining enterprises without commingling cash like a bad family reunion.

This plan's comprehensive: Models, accounts, forms/fields, Syncfusion UI/commands/views, plus the full sync flow. We'll use QBO API minor version 75+ (as of Aug 2025, older ones are deprecated—Intuit's way of saying "move on or get left behind"). Base URL: https://sandbox-quickbooks.api.intuit.com/v3/company/{realmId}/ (switch to production later). All via OAuth 2.0, because nobody wants unsecured data flying around like loose trash on pickup day.

### 1. Models Mapping: Wiley to QBO Entities
Your Wiley models (from AppDbContext.cs: Enterprise, BudgetInteraction, OverallBudget) map to QBO like this—keep 'em segregated for muni compliance (GASB vibes: accrual for enterprises, no mixing pots).

- **Enterprise → QBO Class (for Fund Tracking):** Classes act as "funds" in muni accounting—tag transactions per enterprise to run P&L by Class. Fields:
  - Id (string, read-only): Auto-generated.
  - Name (string, max 100 chars): e.g., "WaterFund" from Enterprise.Name.
  - Active (bool): True by default.
  - FullyQualifiedName (string, read-only): For sub-classes, e.g., "WaterFund:Operations".
  - SubClass (bool): Use for sub-budgets (e.g., under Water: Maintenance).
  - SyncToken (string): For optimistic locking on updates.

  In Wiley: Extend Enterprise model with QboClassId (string). Sync: If no Id, create Class; else update.

- **BudgetInteraction/OverallBudget → QBO Budget + Accounts:** Budgets are query-only via API (no create/update—lame limitation, so use UI/CSV import workarounds). Map interactions to Account links. Budget fields (read-only):
  - Id (string).
  - Name (string): e.g., "FY2025 Water Budget".
  - StartDate/EndDate (date): Fiscal year.
  - BudgetType (enum: ProfitAndLoss, BalanceSheet).
  - BudgetEntryType (enum: Monthly, Quarterly, Yearly).
  - BudgetDetail (array): Lines with AccountRef, ClassRef, Amount (decimal).
  - Active (bool).

  Workaround: Compute in Wiley, export CSV (Account, Class, Month1 Amount, etc.), import to QBO. Then query API for validation.

- **Expenses/Revenues → QBO Accounts:** Core for tracking. Account fields:
  - Id (string).
  - Name (string, unique): e.g., "WaterRevenue" from MonthlyRevenue.
  - AccountType (enum: Income, Expense, Asset, etc.)—use Income for rates, Expense for ops.
  - Classification (enum: Asset, Liability, etc.).
  - CurrentBalance (decimal, read-only).
  - Description (string): From Enterprise.Notes.
  - TaxCodeRef (ref): For muni exemptions.
  - SubAccount (bool): For breakdowns (e.g., sub of Utilities).

  Best practice for muni: Use sub-accounts under a parent (e.g., Utilities:Water:Expenses). Tag with Class for fund reports.

Update your EF models: Add QboSyncStatus (enum: Pending, Synced, Failed) to Enterprise/BudgetInteraction for tracking.

### 2. Accounts Setup in QBO (Muni-Style)
- **Chart of Accounts:** Parent: "Enterprise Funds". Subs: Per enterprise (Water Revenue as Income, Water Expenses as Expense). Use API to create:
  - POST /account: { "Name": "WaterRevenue", "AccountType": "Income", "Classification": "Revenue" }.
- **Bank Sub-Accounts:** For fund isolation—create sub-accounts under main checking (e.g., Checking:WaterFund).
- **Best Practices:** Enable class tracking in QBO (Company Settings > Advanced). Run reports like Profit & Loss by Class for enterprise health. For utilities: Track depreciation as non-cash expense. Avoid over-syncing—batch API calls (up to 30 ops per batch).

### 3. Forms & Fields: Syncing Data
- **Key Forms:** Invoices (for rates/billing), Bills (expenses), Journal Entries (adjustments). Fields to map:
  - Invoice: Line items with AccountRef (e.g., WaterRevenue), ClassRef (WaterFund), Amount from MonthlyRevenue, Description from Notes. Custom Fields for muni specifics (e.g., CitizenCount—QBO supports up to 3 per entity, string/num/date).
  - Bill: VendorRef, Line with ExpenseAccountRef (e.g., WaterExpenses), ClassRef.
  - JournalEntry: For transfers between funds (e.g., shared costs)—Lines with Debit/Credit, AccountRef, ClassRef.

- **API Endpoints:** CRUD for most (POST/GET/PUT/DELETE /entity/{id}). Query: GET /query?query=SELECT * FROM Invoice WHERE ClassRef='WaterFund'. Limitations: Budgets read-only, so fields like BudgetDetail pulled but not pushed.

- **Sync Fields Strategy:** In QuickBooksService.cs, map Wiley fields bi-directionally. E.g., Enterprise.CurrentRate → Invoice.Amount. Handle partial updates with SyncToken to avoid conflicts.

### 4. Syncfusion Integration: Commands, Views, Etc.
Tie QBO sync into your WPF UI (MainWindow.xaml, ViewModels). Use Syncfusion for pro visuals—SfButton for sync commands, SfDataGrid for account views.

- **Views (MainWindow.xaml Extensions):**
  - Add Tab: "QBO Sync" with SfRibbon (buttons: Connect, Sync Enterprises, Pull Budgets).
  - SfDataGrid: Bind to synced QBO accounts/classes—columns: Name, Type, Balance (from API pull).
  - SfChart: Visualize budgets vs. actuals (pull from /reports/BudgetOverview?classid=WaterFund).
  - SfDiagram: Nodes as enterprises, connectors as budget interactions—add QBO ClassRefs as labels.

- **Commands (in MainViewModel.cs/EnterpriseViewModel.cs):**
  - Use CommunityToolkit.Mvvm RelayCommand.
  - [RelayCommand] public async Task SyncToQbo() { await _qbService.SyncEnterprise(this.Enterprise); } // Calls API POST.
  - Loading: SfBusyIndicator during async ops.
  - Error Popups: SfMessageBox for "QBO says no—check your token, dummy."

- **Full UI Flow:** Button click → OAuth if needed → ProgressBar (SfProgressBar) → Refresh Grid/Chart with pulled data. Export budgets as CSV via SfSpreadsheet.

### 5. Full Integration Flow & Code Snippets
- **OAuth Setup (in QuickBooksService.cs):**
  ```csharp
  private async Task<string> GetAccessToken()
  {
      // Redirect to auth URL, handle callback for code
      var client = new HttpClient();
      var response = await client.PostAsync("https://oauth.platform.intuit.com/oauth2/v1/tokens/bearer", new FormUrlEncodedContent(new[]
      {
          new KeyValuePair<string, string>("grant_type", "authorization_code"),
          new KeyValuePair<string, string>("code", authCode),
          new KeyValuePair<string, string>("redirect_uri", "http://localhost:8080/callback"),
          new KeyValuePair<string, string>("client_id", ClientId),
          new KeyValuePair<string, string>("client_secret", ClientSecret)
      }));
      var json = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
      // Parse access_token, store in secure settings (e.g., Azure Key Vault)
      return JObject.Parse(json)["access_token"].ToString();
  }
  ```
  Scopes: com.intuit.quickbooks.accounting. Refresh every hour.

- **Sync Flow:**
  1. User clicks Sync: Check token, refresh if expired.
  2. For each Enterprise: Create/update Class, then Accounts.
  3. Compute budgets in Wiley, export CSV: "Account,Class,Jan,Feb..." → User imports to QBO.
  4. Pull: Query budgets/accounts, update Wiley models.
  5. Batch for efficiency: POST /batch with ops array.
  6. Error Handling: Catch 401 (reauth), 429 (rate limit—retry after delay), log with Serilog.

- **Testing/Best Practices:** Sandbox first. Limit API calls (100/min per realm). Webhooks for real-time updates (subscribe to entity changes). For muni: Audit trails via reports; no custom fields overuse (limit 3).

There—your integration plan, ready to roll without blowing the budget. If the Clerk hates it, blame QBO's budget API quirks. What's next, tweak the code or demo time?
